<p style="text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #333333;letter-spacing:2px;padding:5px 8px;text-align:justify;">To experience the festivals
 of Kerala is to experience her joie de vivre, her energy, her vivacity and her sparkle. There are many festivals that
 manifest the communal and social unity of the people. Most of the acclaimed art forms of the land have developed, evolved
 and grown in stature, primarily through their association with festivals over the years.

While many of the festivals are associated with places of worship, secular festivals also abound. Onam is the State festival
 of Kerala. Among the religious festivals, Vishu, Navaratri, Deepavali, Shivaratri, and Thiruvathira are the main Hindu
 festivals. Ramzan, Bakrid, Muharram and Milad-e-Sharief are the important festivals observed or celebrated by the Muslims,
 while Christmas and Easter are the major ones for the Christians of the land. Apart from this, a number of small,
 distinctive festivals are celebrated at places of worship of all the three communities.</p>

 <img style="float:left;border:10px solid green"src="onam.jpg" width="500" height="300">
 <p Style="text-align:justify;">
 It is enough for one to try and understand the many festive occasions in Kerala in order to get familiar with Kerala’s
 history, culture and heritage. And the festival of Onam is a grand event for Keralites.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify">
There is a myth behind Onam. Long time ago, Kerala was ruled by a demon king by the name of Mahabali, who had conquered
 all the three worlds. He always cared for the welfare of his subjects, the fame of which envied the gods and lessened
 their significance. The gods sought the help of Lord Vishnu for regaining their glory and significance. Lord Vishnu agreed
 to their request. He took the form of Vaamana (a dwarf Brahmin) and requested King Mahabali to grant 3 foot of land for
 meditation purpose. As Vaamana began to measure, he assumed a massive form and measured two foot of Mahabali’s kingdom and
 asked him about the third. To this, Mahabali lowered his head and Vaamana placed his foot on his head and was sent to the
 nether world. The opportunity granted to Mahabali by Vaamana to visit his subjects once a year is celebrated as Thiruvonam,
 the most auspicious day of the Onam festival.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Onam also heralds the New Year for Malayalees. It is also the harvest festival of the State, starting from Atham asterism
 and concluding on the Thiruvonam asterism. The ten-day festival is marked by floral carpets (pookalam) at households,
 giving of new clothes (onakodi) and grand traditional feast (onasadya).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
During Onam people engage in various entertainments. Boat race (vallam kali) is one of them, the thrill of which is to
 finish first by singing vanchi pattu (song of the boat). Boat races are confined to southern districts of Kerala like
 Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta.

Thiruvathirakali, also known as Kaikottikali, is a women’s group dance, quite popular during Onam.

 <img style="float:left;border:10px solid #00b300"src="boat.jpg" width="500" height="275">
 <p style="text-align:justify;">
The backwaters and rivers of Kerala were the scene of vallam kali (vallam means boat and kali means play) since ancient times.
 They attain festive proportions during Onam season, the harvest festival of Kerala. Both men and women participate in the
 vallam kali. The different types of boats that participate in races are chundan vallam (snake boat), iruttu kuthi, churulan
 vallam, cheru vallam etc. Vanchipaattu is a kind of poetry, which is sung during vallam kali. These songs are rooted in
 nathonnatha vrutham, a pulsating rhythm, which resembles the crest and trough of the waves in the water. The rhythmic 
 rowing of the oars by the rovers in the boats matches the rhythmic singing of vanchipaattu (song of the boat).</p>

 <h2 style="text-shadow:2px 1px 1px #333333;">VISHU</h2>
 <img style="float:left;border:10px solid #00e600"src="boat.jpg" width="500" height="275">
 <p style="text-align:justify;">
 If Onam is the number one festival of Keralites, Vishu takes the second spot. It comes on the first day of the Malayalam
 month Medam (April), which is also the Spring Equinox, when the duration of day and night are equal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
On the day of Vishu, seeing the Vishukanni (offerings placed in prayers rooms at homes and and in front of deities in temples)
 as the first thing in the morning is believed to be the harbinger of the year’s prosperity and good luck. The offerings
 comprise flowers of golden shower (kani konna) tree, vegetables, fruits, traditional lamp, metal mirrors, coins, rice, holy
 text etc. placed inside a metal vessel called uruli. A lighted bell metal lamp called nilavilakku is also placed alongside.
 Giving of handsel (kaineettam) by an elderly person in the family to younger members is an integral part of the celebrations.</p>
